### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Project title: How Does Friendship Change from being Single to being Married?
+ This project is conducted by Manan Brahmbhatt

+ Project summary: This report is an investigation into whether I, a single guy, will be able to continue to be friends with people that are married. I used 'cleaned_hm' and 'demographic' data from HappyDB and explored the following questions:
  + Do friends lose importance in the life of a merried individual?
  + How can I continue to keep and grow my frienship with a married individual?
